      <h1>About EcoFinds</h1>
      
      <p>
        Welcome to EcoFinds, your premier destination for sustainable second-hand shopping. 
        Founded in 2025, our mission is to promote a circular economy by giving pre-loved items 
        a second life while reducing waste and environmental impact.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        At EcoFinds, we believe that one person's unused item is another's treasure. 
        Our platform connects sellers looking to declutter responsibly with buyers seeking 
        unique, affordable, and environmentally-friendly alternatives to new products.
      </p>
      
      <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.5rem', margin: '2rem 0 1rem', color: '#4CAF50' }}>Our Mission</h2>
      
      <p>
        Our mission is threefold:
      </p>
      
      <ul style={{ marginLeft: '2rem', marginBottom: '1.5rem', listStyle: 'disc' }}>
        <li>To reduce waste by extending the lifecycle of products</li>
        <li>To provide affordable alternatives to new items</li>
        <li>To build a community of environmentally conscious consumers</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        By choosing second-hand, you're not just saving money â€“ you're making a positive 
        impact on the planet by reducing demand for new production and keeping perfectly 
        usable items out of landfills.
      </p>
      
      <h2 style={{ fontSize: '1.5rem', margin: '2rem 0 1rem', color: '#4CAF50' }}>Our Story</h2>
      
      <p>
        EcoFinds was born from a simple observation: too many quality items end up discarded 
        while others shop for the same items new. Our founder, an environmental science graduate, 
        saw an opportunity to create a platform that makes second-hand shopping easy, enjoyable, 
        and accessible to everyone.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        What started as a small local initiative has grown into a thriving marketplace with a 
        dedicated community of eco-conscious buyers and sellers. We're proud of the positive 
        environmental impact we've made so far, and we're just getting started.
      </p>
