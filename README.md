## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Build the client-side application:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
5. The application will be available at http://localhost:12000

### File Permissions

If you encounter permission issues when trying to modify files or run build commands, ensure that all files have the correct permissions:

```bash
# From the project root directory
chmod -R 755 .
```

This grants read, write, and execute permissions to the owner, and read and execute permissions to others, which should be sufficient for most development workflows.

### Development

```
npm run dev
```
